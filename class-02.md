# Reading Notes

## Ch.2 Text

-HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page.
-They also provide semantic information like where emphasis should be placed.
- structural examples
  - heading <h1></h1> - <h6></h6>
  - paragraphs <p></p>
  - Bold <b></b> Italic <i></i>
 - Semantic
  - strong <strong></strong>
  - emphasis <em></em>
  - quotations <blockquote></blockquote> smaller quotations <q></q>  

  ## Ch.10

  - Css treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and users rules to indicate how that elements should look.
  -Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like). 
  - Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at a different elements.
  -Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that ayou want to change, and the values of those properties.
  - Css rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.

  ## Javascript Ch. 2 Basic javascript

  - A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a  step in a recipe
  - Scripts contain very precise instructions.
  - Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.
  - Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.
  - JavaScript distinguishes between number 0-9, string (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
  - Expressions evaluate into a single value.
  - Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

  ## Javascript Ch. 4 Decisions & Loops

  - Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.
  - Comparison operators (===, !==, ==, !=, <,>, <=,=>) are used to compare two operands.
  - Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.
  - if...else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true and another if it is false.
  - switch statments allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match).
  - Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
  - All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
  - There are three types of loop: for, while, and do....while. Each repeats a set of statments.
